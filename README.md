# Emotopia-Mood-Enhancer

## Overview

Emotopia-Mood-Enhancer is an AI-driven music recommendation system that suggests songs based on the user's current emotional state. The system uses computer vision and emotion recognition techniques to detect the user's facial expressions and determine their mood. It then interacts with the user to confirm and refine the detected emotion before recommending a personalized playlist.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Utilizes the camera to detect faces in real-time.
- **Emotion Recognition**: Analyzes facial expressions to determine the user's initial emotion.
- **User Interaction**: Engages with the user through a survey to confirm the detected emotion and gather additional emotional context.
- **Personalized Music Recommendation**: Suggests a playlist based on the user's final emotional state.
- **Audio Feedback**: Provides audio feedback to enhance user experience.

## Workflow

1. **Face Detection**: The system opens the camera and detects faces using the `det_faces` function from the `cv_modules.camera_det_faces` module.
2. **Face Recognition**: Identifies the user by name using the `face_reco` function from the `cv_modules.face_reco` module.
3. **Initial Emotion Detection**: Determines the user's initial emotion from their facial expressions using the `find_emotion` function from the `cv_modules.emotion_recognition` module.
4. **User Survey**: Asks the user if the detected emotion is accurate and gathers more information through a survey using the `survey` function from the `surveying_part` module.
5. **Final Emotion Determination**: Asks additional questions to refine the user's emotional state using the `generate_questions` function from the `surveying_part` module.
6. **Audio Feedback**: Provides an audio message to the user with a playlist recommendation based on their final emotion using the `run_audio` function from the `utils.io_devices` module.
7. **Music Recommendation**: Recommends a playlist tailored to the user's current mood using the `recommend_song` function from the `recommendation.emotopia` module.
